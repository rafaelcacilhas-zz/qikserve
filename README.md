# First day
Learned to deploy the API, started the architecture

## Second day
Home page and cart logic

### Third day (saturday)
Finished the Cart page and made a quick User page.
Fixed a bug when adding the same item on the cart

## Fourth day 
Did the CartItem component and all the calculations related to the price
Solved all bugs


## Question 1 - 
About two or three hours a day, during four days. The details can be seen above.

## Question 2 - 
There are a lot of small changes to the design that can be made. The biggest one 
would be to implement the possibility to edit the cart; I did not implement a "remove from cart" 
or "edit" cart; you can do this by adding the product again and the software will override it, 
which is not intuitive for the user, but it's easy to implement. 

## Question 3 - 
The most important: it need CORS. Took a while to figure out how to enable the access from the front-end 
and this should be dealt in the back-end. Besides that it would be nice if the API was hosted on the web,
which would algo solve the previous issue.
In a design point of view I would add a image for each food so the front-end can better design an app.  

## Question 4 -
I had some problems calculating the discount, because I did it in the CartItem component and needed them
in the Cart page. In the end I just used the code to calculate it again in the Cart Page.

## Question 5 - 
This was a very practical and direct test. I would have liked to know in more details what is expected from
me. I didn't know if I should take one more day to make it responsive, for instance.
